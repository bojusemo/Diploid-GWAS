# Diploid-GWAS

An workflow for quality control (QC), GWAS and post-GWAS analyses for diploid species.

Genome-wide association studies require a previous quality control and posterior analysis annotation and enrichment of the genomic regions where are the associated markers. Have been developed tools to perform these analysis in the R environment. We integrate some of these tools to do the three steps into a workflow: quality control, genome-wide association studies and annotation and enrichment of the genomic regions.

Code and toy data are in three separate folders for: QC and GWAS for data with Illumina structure, QC and GWAS for data with general structure, and Post-GWAS from gene name.
