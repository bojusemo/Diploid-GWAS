# Ruminant-GWAS
Pipeline for quality control, GWAS and post-GWAS analyses

Associated to genome-wide association studies require a previous quality control and posterior analysis annotation and enrichment of the genomic regions where are the associated markers. Have been developed tools to perform these analysis in the R environment, but none integrate these three steps into a workflow. This workflow integrates currently R tools to performance quality control, genome-wide association studies and annotation and enrichment of the genomic regions.
